                 <p>Toyota's halo sports car, the 2023 GR Supra, delivers enough excitement, style, and drama to make up for the brand's more sedate sedans, hatchbacks, and SUVs. Developed and built alongside the BMW Z4 convertible, the GR Supra offers similar build quality and simpler—but still handsome—interior materials inside. The entry-level 255-hp turbocharged four-cylinder provides ample power, but we can't help but adore the ferocious, optional 382-hp turbocharged 3.0-liter BMW inline-six that makes this two-seater fly. Rear-wheel drive is the only setup, and the GR Supra's sure-footed chassis and sharp steering enable it to come alive on twisty roads and race courses. Sure, it may borrow a little too heavily from the BMW parts bin for some Toyota fanboys, and its sweptback exterior design creates some awfully large blind spots, but even so, the GR Supra remains one of our favorite sports cars. It's a driver's car and an enthusiast's delight, making it a no-brainer for our annual 10Best cars list.</p>

                 <p>The Toyota Supra MK4 is equipped with a twin-turbo 3.0-litre straight six which can produce up 320Hp and around 440 Nm of torque and is known as the 2JZ-series. The acceleration of this car from 0 to 100kmh is around 4.9 seconds, and the top speed can reach up to 277kmh.p>

             <div class="content">
                 <p>Though it shares its bones with the regular BMW 2-series, the 2023 M2 takes that car's already impressive performance and turns the heat way up. Not only does it sport a racier appearance and a chassis tuned for thrilling handling, but its twin-turbocharged inline-six pumps out 453 horsepower—just 20 shy of the output of the M3's standard engine. Like the previous M2, the new one employs rear-wheel drive and comes with a standard six-speed manual transmission, so we're hoping it also preserves its predecessor's delightful driving behavior. The new-generation M2 features more tech than the last one, including BMW's latest iDrive 8 infotainment interface and an accompanying digital dashboard. A host of driver-assistance features is now available too. The M2's performance potential, combined with its generous standard equipment, means it's likely to be a double threat—both a track-day hero and a seriously exciting daily driver.</p>

             <div class="content">
                 <p>All good things must come to an end: The fantastic Ford Focus RS enters its final year of production packed with performance paraphernalia and ready to desecrate a racetrack near you. Ford's hard-core hatch has a 350-hp turbocharged four-cylinder engine that pairs exclusively with a six-speed manual transmission. Its torque-vectoring all-wheel drive is capable of conquering snow-covered streets or gravel-strewn back roads. While its cheap interior can't be ignored, the RS will still fit four adults and their stuff. Expect its uncompromising ride and restrictive racing seats to weed out the weak, but whoever's left standing is in for one helluva good time.</p>

             <div class="content">
                 <p>Think of the 2022 Ford Mustang Shelby GT500 kind of like a rolling theme park. Its monstrous 760-hp supercharged V-8 launches the coupe with eye-watering force, and its immense grip causes sensations of euphoria or nausea or both. All the while its thrilling exhaust note provides the soundtrack, and a rapid-shifting automatic transmission handles gearchanges for the rear-drive-only coupe. The Shelby GT500 isn't just the mightiest Mustang ever, it's also the most powerful road car Ford has ever built. We named it to our 2022 Editors' Choice list, too. Despite the ability to soil people's undergarments on demand, it's still a Mustang at heart, meaning it doubles as a daily driver. Opting for the Carbon Fiber Track Pack optimizes the GT500's performance, but it also costs almost a quarter of the Shelby's base price. For some owners, that money will be better spent on fueling this thirsty beast or paying the inevitable influx of speeding tickets.</p>
